$$$ \Rightarrow $$$ 10 diagrams to remember

## Lecture 1

- **The SW process** = A structured set of activities required to develop a software system.

#### SW process structure
- Requirements specification
- Analysis and design
- Implementation
- Validation and verification
- Evolution

#### Different perspectives
- **External perspective**
	- Use case diagram
- **Structural perspective**
	- Class diagram, Object diagram, Component diagram, Package diagram, Deployment diagram, Composite structure diagram
- **Interaction perspective**
	- Sequence diagram, Communication diagram, Interaction overview diagram, Timing diagram
- **Behavioral perspective**
	- Activity diagram, State diagram

### Use case diagram
- Models system boundary = **Subject**, **Actors** and **Use cases** + **Relationships**
- Shows functional requirements
- Use cases are always written from the point of view of the actors
- Primart actor = trigger
- Secondary actor = user / interacter

## Lecture 2

#### Requirements should be
 **Complete**
▪ Are all functions required by the customer included?
 **Consistent**
▪ Are there any requirements conflicts or contradictions?
 **Precise**
▪ Is there one and only interpretation in the system context?
 **Verifiable**
▪ Can the requirements be checked?
 **Realistic**
▪ Can the req. be implemented with the available resources,
such as budget, time and technology?

#### Non-functional requirements
- **Product req**
- **Organisational req**
- **External req**

### Activity diagram
- to model activity in UC, collaborations of classes...
- **Action nodes** = atomic unit of work
- **Control nodes** = control the flow
- **Object nodes** = flow of a object, input / output
- **(Control / object) flows** = edges
- Pre / post conditions
- **Fork / join nodes**

## Lecture 3

#### Architectural abstraction
- **Analysis** = architecture in small (detail)
- **Design** = architecture in large (detail)

#### Fundamental views of software systems
- **Function oriented view** = part of structured analysis
- **Data oriented view** = part of structured analysis
- **Object oriented view** = object oriented analysis

#### Structured methods
- **SASS**: DeMarco Structured Analysis and System Spec
- **LM**: Logical Modelling: Context $$$ \rightarrow $$$ DFD $$$ \rightarrow $$$ ERD $$$ \rightarrow $$$ better ERD $$$ \rightarrow $$$ better DFD
- **YMSA**: Focuses on DFD of processes and subprocesses
- **SSADM**: 

#### Object oriented methods
- **OMT**: Object modelling technique: the basic one
- **RUP**: Rational Unified Process: Risk driven iterations, component-based, 
- **UP**: Unified Process: Simplified RUP: Req: UCD $$$ \rightarrow $$$ Analysis: Class diagram Interaction and Activity Diagrams $$$ \rightarrow $$$ Design: refined ClassD and ComponentD

### Class Diagram
- **Analytical CD** = shorten
- **Design CD** = visibility (+, #, -), static, defaults, function types
- «use» - the client makes use of the supplier to implement its behaviour
- «call» - the client operation invokes the supplier operation
- «parameter» - the supplier is a parameter of the client operation
- «send» - the client (an operation) sends the supplier (a signal) to some unspecified target
- «instantiate» - the client is an instance of the supplier
- **Abstract class** = *italic*

## Lecture 4

#### Relations between Objects & Classes
- **Association** = between Classes
- **Link** = between Objects
- Navigability = source  $$$ \rightarrow $$$ target

### State machines
- **Behavioural** / **Protocol** state machines
- **State** = node
- **Event** = edge description
- **Transition** = oriented edge 
- [precondition] event1, event2 / [postcondition]
